I am a PhD candidate at the [University of Oslo](https://www.uio.no/), funded by a [Marie Skłodowska-Curie](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/) fellowship. My research focuses on statistics and machine learning, with a particular interest in Gradient Boosting methods for graph data analysis.

I hold a Master's degree in Mathematics (Stochastics and Data Science) from the University of Turin and a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from the University of Trento. Before starting my PhD, I worked as a Research Assistant at the Free University of Bolzano.

Originally from the Dolomites, I enjoy bikepacking and serve as a volunteer [firefighter](http://www.vigilidelfuococles.it/organico.html) in my home community.
