PhD candidate, funded by a Marie Skłodowska-Curie fellowship, specialized in statistics and machine learning with focus on explainable AI.

## Experience

**PhD in Statistics** -- University of Oslo, 2021 -- Present

Interdisciplinary collaboration between Chemistry and Statistics departments to adapt machine learning methods to big molecular datasets and non-tabular data.

* Awarded a Marie Skłodowska-Curie fellowship.
* Built novel XGBoost-based algorithm for non-tabular data with focus on model interpretability and developed a Scikit-learn compatible Python package for the research community ([Extended PathBoost](https://test.pypi.org/project/extended-path-boost/)).
* Optimized parallel processing pipelines on remote servers, reducing computation time by 50%.
* Published in international research journals: [A path-based boosting algorithm for exploring transition metal compounds](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1471082X251407458), Observed patterns in COVID epidemic data and epidemic models.

**Data Scientist** -- Arctech Robotics, 2025 -- Present

Developed computer vision model for automated battery detection in waste streams to enable robotic sorting systems.

* Built and trained YOLO object detection model to identify batteries in mixed waste with 88% real-time accuracy.
* Managed end-to-end image annotation workflow using Roboflow.
* Collaborated with robotics team to ensure model outputs integrate seamlessly with robotic arm retrieval systems.

**Data Scientist** -- Smart Data Factory, 2021

Worked on the SALSA project, classifying climbing routes using clustering algorithms on data from sensors applied to climbing walls.

* Implemented end-to-end data pipelines, from sensor data collection and cleaning to clustering analysis.
* Reported results providing actionable insights for business optimization, leading to a revenue increase of 2%.
* Shared mathematical and statistical expertise in IT/engineering team to guide data analysis.
* Explored reinforcement learning algorithms, with focus on Q-learning.
